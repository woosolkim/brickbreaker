# Brick Breaker Game

A simple, classic brick breaker game made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript using geminicli.

It took about 3 minutes to create.

## How to Play

1.  **Open the `index.html` file** in any modern web browser.
2.  **Move the paddle:** Use the **Left/Right Arrow Keys** or the **A/D Keys** to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen.
3.  **Break the bricks:** Bounce the ball off the paddle to break the bricks at the top of the screen.
4.  **Collect items:** Breaking a brick may randomly drop a `+` item. Catch it with your paddle to get an extra ball.
5.  **Don't lose the ball:** If you miss the ball and it falls to the bottom, you lose a life. The game is over when you have no balls left.
6.  **Win the game:** You win by clearing all the bricks from the screen.
